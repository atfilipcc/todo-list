# todo-list

A basic todo-list made with no libraries in frameworks. Built in 2 days during a weekend test for the Salt bootcamp. Hosted on https://filipcc-todo.netlify.app/

A second branch has the todo-list built in React using traditional stateful class components and prop drilling. Hosted on https://filipcc-todo-react.netlify.app/.
